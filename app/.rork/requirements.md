# App Requirements: Glyph Pet

> A Nothing-aesthetic virtual pet you raise, feed, and play with through minimal monochrome interactions

## Core Problem

Tamagotchi nostalgia meets modern minimal design — users want a low-pressure, ambient digital companion that lives on their phone. Existing virtual pet apps are cluttered, ad-heavy, and over-designed. Glyph Pet strips the genre to its essence: monochrome glyphs, simple gestures, quiet rituals.

## Target User

- **Who:** Design-conscious millennials and Gen-Z who appreciate Nothing Phone aesthetics, minimalism, and lo-fi digital experiences
- **Goal:** Own a calming, low-maintenance virtual pet that rewards daily check-ins without pressure or guilt
- **Context:** Quick sessions (30s–2min) during commute, breaks, or bedtime wind-down — ambient engagement, not hardcore gaming

## MVP Features

### Must Have

- Requires: local-storage

**Day/Night Cycle**
- Pet behavior and visuals shift based on real-world time of day

## Platform Requirements

- **iOS:** Yes
