  "tagline": "A Nothing-aesthetic virtual pet you raise, feed, and play with through minimal monochrome interactions",
  "problem": "Tamagotchi nostalgia meets modern minimal design — users want a low-pressure, ambient digital companion that lives on their phone. Existing virtual pet apps are cluttered, ad-heavy, and over-designed. Glyph Pet strips the genre to its essence: monochrome glyphs, simple gestures, quiet rituals.",
  "targetUser": {
    "demographic": "Design-conscious millennials and Gen-Z who appreciate Nothing Phone aesthetics, minimalism, and lo-fi digital experiences",
    "goal": "Own a calming, low-maintenance virtual pet that rewards daily check-ins without pressure or guilt",
    "context": "Quick sessions (30s–2min) during commute, breaks, or bedtime wind-down — ambient engagement, not hardcore gaming"
